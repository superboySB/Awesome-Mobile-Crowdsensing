    "This tutorial shows how [WarpDrive](https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive) can be used together with [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning).\n",
    "\n",
    "WarpDrive is a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use RL framework that implements end-to-end deep multi-agent RL on a single GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). Using the extreme parallelization capability of GPUs, it enables [orders-of-magnitude faster RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13976) compared to common implementations that blend CPU simulations and GPU models. WarpDrive is extremely efficient as it runs simulations across multiple agents and multiple environment replicas in parallel and completely eliminates the back-and-forth data copying between the CPU and the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch Lightning is a machine learning framework which [greatly reduces trainer boilerplate code](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), and improves training modularity and flexibility. It abstracts away most of the engineering pieces of code, so users can focus on research and building models, and iterate on experiments really fast. Pytorch Lightning also provides support for easily running the model on any hardware, performing distributed training, model checkpointing, performance profiling, logging and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we demonstrate how to use WarpDrive and PytorchLightning together to train a game of [Tag](https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive/blob/master/example_envs/tag_continuous/tag_continuous.py) where multiple *tagger* agents are trying to run after and tag multiple other *runner* agents. As such, the Warpdrive framework comprises several utility functions that help easily implement any (OpenAI-)*gym-style* RL environment, and furthermore, provides quality-of-life tools to train it end-to-end using just a few lines of code. You may familiarize yourself with WarpDrive with the help of these [tutorials](https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive/tree/master/tutorials).\n",
    "\n",
    "We invite everyone to **contribute to WarpDrive**, including adding new multi-agent environments, proposing new features and reporting issues on our open source [repository](https://github.com/salesforce/warp-drive)."

The game lasts $200$ timesteps. Each agent chooses it's own acceleration and turn actions at every timestep, and we use mechanics to determine how the agents move over the grid.
